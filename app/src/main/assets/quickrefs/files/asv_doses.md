# Doctor's role
- If a doctor encounters a snake bite case outside the hospital kindly manage according to **First Aid** protocol. This section deals with hospital management.
- Recovery position.
- Check ABC.
- O2 as soon as feel needed. Prophylactic O2 in Elapids. Use Resuscitation bag if no ventilator.
- Start IVF NS slow infusion via large bore cannula, fast if shock.
- **Ligature management:**
  - **If clinically seems non-venomous:**
    - Check pulse distal to it. If present remove ligature with proper precautions and counselling. If no pulse and clinically found to be non-venomous then Put BP cuff above the level of it and inflate it more than patient’s BP, then untie tourniquet. Decrease the BP cuff pressure by 10 units after every 10-15 minutes.
  - **If clinically found to be venomous:**
    - If multiple ligatures, then remove all except proximal one.
    - If single or it is the last one remaining among multiple ligatures, then Give loading dose of ASV and prepare atropine neostigmine (AN) if elapid then remove tourniquet. If ASV not available, do nothing here.
- **Take history:** Day or night? Bitten during sleep? Time since bite. Snake identification.
- **Wound examination:**
  - PPS? Occult bite? Sea snakes?
  - Painful, tenderness, bleeding, progressive, blisters, blister colour, necrosis, compartment syndrome examination, Muscle contraction or pain.
- **Systemic examination:**
  - BP, Pulse, RR, SpO2, counting numbers, drooping eyelids and other signs of Neurotoxicity,signs of internal bleeding and Coagulopathy (nausea, vomiting, gum bleeding, dark urine, epistaxis).
- GCS has no value.
- **20WBCT:**
  - First blood drawn for 20 WBCT should be sent for Cross Matching.
- **Pain:**
  - Paracetamol oral or IV.
  - Tramadol 50 mg oral or 50 mg IV can be given.
- **Inj. TT** if no coagulopathy or after correction of coagulopathy.
- **AN** if Neurotoxicity is present.
- **ASV measures** if available:
  - Prepare Adrenaline.
  - Premedications if High risk of anaphylaxis.
- **Start ASV if indicated**.
- **Manage anaphylaxis**.
- Give Antibiotics as  **prophylaxis of cellulitis** after ASV:
  - Inj. Ceftriaxone 1g IV ANST BD x 7 days then Tab. Amoxyclav 625 TDS x 3-7 days.
  - Inj. Metronidazole 400 mg IV thrice daily x 7 days.
  - Adjust for paediatric dose.
- **Lab. Tests** if available.
- **Blood transfusion** is needed in severe bleeding or severely anaemic.
- **Wound management if PPS:**
  - Should be washed with Povidone Iodine but no dressing.
  - Don’t break blisters, let them break and heal spontaneously.
  - If there is local necrosis, excise and apply saline dressings.
  - Wound debridement or surgical intervention can be done by surgeons after 5-6 days of ASV.
- AKI will need **dialysis**:
  - Expected urine output 1ml/kg/hour. If urine output is low or blood in urine, needs FAD.
- If respiratory paralysis imminent consider **ventilation**.
- **Monitoring:**
  - 24 hours monitor at least for non-venomous bite. 48 hours if ASV was given.
- Left over swelling due to viper can be treated by Broad spectrum antibiotics and Magnesium sulphate compressions in the layers of wet bandages changed 2-3 times daily.
- **What to expect**:
  - Cobra responds within 30 minutes. Viper by 15-30 minutes. Krait takes time.
- **Advice on discharge:**
  - Report if any bleeding, pain on bitten site, altered sensorium, breathing difficulty, decreased urine output etc.
  - Teach about the late ASV reaction.
  - Physiotherapy.
- **Diagnosis of death:**
  - GCS doesn’t apply to neurotoxicity (cobra etc.).
  - Non-reactive dilated pupil isn’t a sign of death in snake bite.
- **NOTE**:
  - All the relevant topics will be found below.

# Quick summary
No bite marks mean **No bite** or **Occult bite** by krait. Presence of bite mark means dry bite or non-venomous bite or venomous bite.
## VIPER
**PPS +/- Coagulopathy.**
### Treatment
**Only PPS**:
- ASV
- Local wound treatment
- Monitor for coagulopathy.

**PPS +/- Coagulopathy**:
- ASV
- Blood transfusion
- Supportive treatment
- Dialysis
## COBRA
**PPS + Neuroparalysis**
- Neuroparalysis and it's complications and PPS appears within half an hour to 6 hours.
### Treatment
- Ventilation
- ASV
- AN (Atropine-Neostigmine)
- Local wound treatment
## KRAIT
**Neuroparalysis**
- Neuroparalysis and it's complications.
- There is no PPS (local sign)
- Severe abdominal/umbilical pain with continuous vomiting  (hyperperistalsis) occurs for 3-4 hours.
- All these appears within 6- 24 hours. May be as late as 36 hours.
### Treatment
- Ventilation
- ASV
- **AN (Atropine-Neostigmine):**
  - AN has no effect in Krait bite, still it is given in case of all neuroparalysis. If there is no improvement of Neuroparalysis by AN, it means it is Krait bite and not Cobra bite.
- Calcium Gluconate is choice for recovery of neuroparalysis in Krait.

# First aid
- Don’t catch or kill the snake.
- Reassure that 70% bites are non-venomous and 10-80% of venomous bites are dry.
- Apply splint with anything like sticks, or if hospital to be referred to is more than 30 min away and less than 3 hours away, apply crepe bandage with splint. Crepe bandage or splint should be 1 finger loose.
- Don’t wash wound or disturb the blisters.
- Remove wearable like ornaments etc.
- Nil per oral till reaches hospital.
- In ambulance, keep the patient in recovery position to prevent aspiration with bitten limp resting with minimal movement.
- Refer to hospital that has ASV, Laboratory and Monitoring facility.
- Presence, absence, pattern of bite mark has no significance.

# Venomous Snakes
Only three families in India are venomous. Most common examples of these families are:
- **Elapids (Neuroparalytics):**
  - Najanaja (Indian Cobra) and
  - Bungarus (Indian krait). 
- **Viperadae (Vasculotoxic):**
  - Daboia russalie (Russells’ Viper)
  - Echiscarinatus (Saw scaled viper) and
  - Pit viper
- **Hydrophidae (Myotoxic):**
  - Sea snakes are flat tails.

---
# Risk factors
- **Kraits:** Darkness, Sleeping on the floor.
- **Viper and Cobra:** Day or early darkness, Grassy area or soybean crops, walking bare foot.

---

# Signs usually due to panic
Palpitations, tachycardia, raised BP, tachypnoea, sweating, anxiety, paraesthesia, dilated pupil.

---
# Dry bite
When no venom is injected. But there is no early way to know it. Kraits has no bite mark. So, it is  **Retrospective diagnosis**.

---
# Occult bite
- Krait bite is invisible in naked eye. They are nocturnal. May bite in the early morning while someone is sleeping on the floor. Patient may present with severe abdominal symptoms if early or Neuroparalytic signs if late and without any bite mark or no history of snake bite. The neuroparalytic signs in this case may be confused with GBS or MG.
- **To differentiate:** GB is ascending and Neuroparalysis here is descending. MG can be ruled out by Atropine test.

---
# Signs of neurotoxicity
In chronological order 2P 5D
- Furrowed forehead,
- Ptosis, 
- Diplopia, 
- Dysarthria, 
- Dysphonia, 
- Dyspnoea, 
- Dysphagia, 
- Paralysis in descending manner.

---
# Signs of impending respiratory failure in neurotoxicity
- **Broken neck sign:**
  - Keep Patient supine. Tilt his shoulder. Ask him to
    lift head. If can’t lift neck or head is it called
    Broken neck sign positive. 
- Absent deep tendon reflexes and head lag.
- Can’t count ≥ 30 in single breath. Alternately PEF or SpO2 can be used. 
- Can’t hold breath in inspiration ≥ 45 sec. 
- Can’t complete a sentence in one breath. 
- Children’s cry goes into husky from loud. 
- Tachycardia, hypertension, stridor, ataxia may present

---
# PPS
- Painful progressive swelling (PPS) is the local signs of venom intoxication.
- Typical Inflammation is seen: Rubor, color, dolor, tumor.
- PPS is seen in Russell’s’, Saw scaled viper and Cobra.
- Damage is more prominent in Cobra while bleeding is more prominent in Viper.
- Swelling progresses from limb to even trunk. It must be differentiated from swelling due to  ligature.
- Ecchymosis or bleeding on wound. 
- Blister at or around the wound (reddish black fluids)
- Necrosis often with rancid smell
- It invariably leads to **compartment syndrome:**
  - Examination of distal part reveals: Painful on passive movement, Pallor, Pulseless limb, Paraesthesia over the sensory nerve passing through the compartment, Paralysis or weakened muscle are suggestive of compartment syndrome. Presence of pulse doesn’t rule it out. Put 16G cannula, connect to manometer. If it is more than 30cm of saline/water do a fasciotomy (by surgeon).
- Local lymphadenopathy

---
# Clinical signs of coagulopathy
- Bleeding or ecchymosis in the site of injection of venom is very common in Vipers.
- Gingival bleeding, epistaxis, ecchymosis patches, hematemesis, vomiting, haemoptysis, bleeding per rectum, sub conjunctival haemorrhage, continuous bleeding from bite sight, bleeding from pre-existing wounds like haemorrhoids, healing wounds.
- Petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis, blebs, gangrene etc.
-  Acute abdominal pain due to retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal pain. 
- Asymmetrical pupils indicating intracranial bleeding.

---
# 20 Min Whole Blood Clotting Test (20WBCT)
- 5ml venous blood each from patient and a healthy person in two different test tubes.
- Keep undisturbed for 20 minutes.
- Tilt slightly and compare
- **Interpretation:**
  - **No clotting:**
    - Coagulopathy by Vipers -> Give ASV and repeat 20 WBCT 6 hour after ASV.
  - **Clotted:**
    - Neuroparalytic Symptoms present -> Elapids -> Give ASV and repeat 20 WBCT at 0 and 6 hour after ASV. 
    - Neuroparalytic symptoms absent -> There is no Coagulopathic effect yet -> Repeat 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27 hours to monitor for coagulopathy.

---
# Investigations
**PT-apTT, CBC, LFT, RFT, ECG, RBS, S. Amylase, 2D ECHO, USG WA**
- Urine RE for albumin and blood.
- Neutrophilic leucocytosis: Venom absorbed.
- Thrombocytopenia: Viper hematotoxicity.
- Hb%: Either way.
- Raised S. Creatinine: AKI from Viper/Sea snake.
- Raised Amylase: Pancreatic injury.
- Raised PT, apTT: Haematotoxicity by viper.
- Dark brown urine: Sea snakes.
- Haematuria: Viper.
- ECG may show nonspecific changes.

# ASV
- **Indications:** Give ASV if signs and symptoms of envenomation are present, with or without lab tests. No skin tests are required.  
- **Contraindications:** None are absolute.  
- **Anaphylaxis:** Fear of anaphylaxis is **not a reason to delay ASV** if it is indicated.  
- **Dosage:** Same in children, adults, and pregnant women.  
- **Swelling:**  
  - Indicated in **rapidly developing swelling.**  
  - Purely local swelling of several hours duration, even after a venomous snake bite, is **not an indication.**  
- **Timing:** ASV can be given even after weeks of the bite if indicated.  
- **Two types:**
  - Polyvalent Freeze-dried heat stable ASV (lyophilised)
  - Neat liquid heat labile ASV: Ensure cold chain.
- **Not available for Sea snakes and Pit Viper.**
