Neonatal jaundice is common, occurring in 60% in term and 80% in preterm infants.
## Physiological jaundice
- Appears after 24 hours of life, decreases after 5â€“6 days, and undetectable after 14 days.
- Maximum values seldom exceed 15 mg/dL.
## Severe Jaundice- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Any jaundice visible in first 24 hours of life.
- Yellow staining of palms and soles or deep yellow appearance (demands lab. test).
- Bilirubin values >95 percentile for gestation/weight/age in hours by AAP Chart or NICE chart.
- Warning signs of encephalopathy such as poor feeding and lethargy.
## Screening
- Before discharge 24-72 hrs from birth, all babies must be evaluated clinically for bilirubin levels and confirmed objectively when in doubt by laboratory investigation, preferably serial estimation.
- Clinical assessment cof severity can be done by Kramer's criteria under natural light:
- Normal babies even after discharge must be clinically screened within 48 hour and high risk within 24 hour and then continue screening clinically till day 5-6 of life.

## Investigations
- Total serum bilirubin (TSB)
- ABO and Rh typing of mother and baby (Baby with RH -ve mother needs ABO and RH typing immediately after birth)
- Suspected hemolysis: CBC, Reticulocyte count, PBS for cell morphology, Direct Coomb's test.
- G6PD
- For prolonged jaundice (Visibly detectable jaundice beyond 2 weeks of age in a term and beyond 3 weeks of age in a preterm infant): Total and direct bilirubin, TFT, urine for reducing substance and culture. Ultrasound abdomen to exclude biliary atresia.
## Prevention
- Early initiation and frequent breastfeeding by mother.
## Criteria for Phototherapy
- Any jaundice visible in first 24 hours of life (send TSB first).
- Jaundice involving palms and soles (send TSB first).
- TSB is above the respective line in the chart.
