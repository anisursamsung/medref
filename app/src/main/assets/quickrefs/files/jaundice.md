## Red Flags
- Onset **<24 hrs**
- **Rapid rise** >5 mg/dL/day
- **TSB >95th percentile** on age-specific chart
- **Prolonged** (>14 d term, >21 d preterm)
- Signs of **encephalopathy** (lethargy, hypotonia, poor feeding, seizures)

---

## Common Causes
- **Physiological** – peak D3–5, resolves <2wks
- **Breastfeeding jaundice** – poor intake, dehydration
- **Breast milk jaundice** – persistent, otherwise well baby
- **Hemolysis** – Rh/ABO incompatibility, G6PD, spherocytosis
- **Others** – sepsis, hypothyroidism, cholestasis, cephalohematoma

---

## Quick Algorithm
1. **Assess onset + risk factors**
    - <24h → workup for hemolysis/sepsis
2. **Check TSB** → plot on **Bhutani/AAP chart**
3. **Management by threshold:**
    - **Below line** → observe, ensure feeding
    - **Above phototherapy line** → start phototherapy
    - **Extreme risk / encephalopathy** → exchange transfusion
4. **Supportive** – hydration, breastfeeding support
5. **Investigate** if atypical/prolonged (TSH, LFTs, urine, Coombs)

## Take-Home
- **Most are benign.**
- **Don’t miss hemolysis or sepsis.**
- **Early detection + phototherapy saves brains.**
