    The Indian Bengali calendar follows the lunar phases and hence it is hard to synchronize by
    a formula. On the other hand Bangladeshi calendar has been messed up
    by adopting the new rule of Poela Boisakh starting on same English day every year.
    This Converter is more aligned with Bangladeshi new calendar system which differes
    with Indian Bengali system by some days. So, this should be used for rough estimation. 1-5 days of error can occur specially if you want Indian System."
