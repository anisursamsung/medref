The **APGAR score** is a quick test performed on a newborn at **1 minute** and **5 minutes** after birth to assess adaptation to extrauterine life and the need for resuscitation.

---

## Scoring & Interpretation

- **7–10**: Normal, generally indicates good adaptation.  
- **4–6**: Moderate depression, may require some resuscitation.  
- **0–3**: Severe distress, requires immediate resuscitation.

## Notes

- Scores are usually assessed at **1 min** and **5 min**; a **10 min score** may be documented if < 7 at 5 minutes.  
- APGAR is **not used to predict long-term outcome**; it is primarily an immediate assessment tool.  
- Should be interpreted in the **clinical context** of the newborn’s condition.
